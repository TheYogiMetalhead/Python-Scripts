# Functions

# A function is a piece of code that performs a unit of work, so far I have encountered the print() function, which outputs a message to the screen.

# Keywords

# A keyword is a reserved word in a programming language that performs a specific purpose, examples are:
# Values: True, False, None
# Conditions: if, elif, else
# Logical operators: and, or, not
# Loops: for, in, while, break, continue
# Functions: def, return  

# Arithmetic operators

# Python can calculate numbers using common mathematical operators, along with some special operators, such as:
# x + y           Addition + operator returns the sum of x plus y
# x - y           Subtraction - operator returns the difference of x minus y
# x * y           Multiplication * operator returns the product of x times y
# x / y           Division / operator returns the quotient of x divided by y
# x**e            Exponent ** operator returns the result of raising x to the power of e 
# x**2            Square expression returns x squared
# x**3            Cube expression returns x cubed
# x**(1/2)        Square root (Â½) or (0.5) fractional exponent operator returns the square root of x
# x // y          Floor division operator returns the integer part of the integer division of x by y
# x % y           Modulo operator returns the remainder part of the integer division of x by y

# Order of operations

# The order of operations are to be calculated from left to right in the following order: 

# Parentheses ( ), { }, [ ]
# Exponents xe   (x**e)
# Multiplication * and Division /  
# Addition + and Subtraction -    

# The PEMDAS mnemonic device may be helpful in remembering the order.
